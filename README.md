# A simple CRM application

See it live at [George Anthony](https://crm.georgeanthony.net).

Send, receive, & schedule individual & mass text messages, buy and burn numbers in specific area codes, and save contacts with notes.

## Mass Messaging 

Send mass texts by typing or pasting numbers, or by using the excel spreadsheet uploader to automatically extract anything that resembles a phone number in that document.

### `double text & stop protection`

By virtue of being built on Twilio, a simple "stop" response in addition to other various common opt-out responses will remove the ability to text that specific number until a "start" or similar opt-in response is sent.\
A "double text" setting exists on the `settings` page for mass messages, allowing you to realiable send or schedule marketing campaign messages without fear of sending a number multiple messages.

## Numbers

Buy, swap, & burn numbers on the fly for tons of area codes throughout the US.

## Contacts

Save contacts with multiple numbers, notes, and tags.

### `tags`

Use tags to categorize contacts, combined with message scheduling for the ultimate marketing campaign solution.
